Assignments for [Berkeley CS 285: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Decision Making, and Control](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/).

in `hw1`  -  `hw5` , there are my coding implementations,

during learning the course , I wrote some notes below:

- [CS188_notes	](cs188notes.pdf)which cover basic MDPs and RL
- [CS285_notes	](cs285notes.pdf)which cover Deep RL notes
